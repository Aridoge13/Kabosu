## Mission
To revolutionize personalized medicine by integrating multi-omics data, deep learning, and pharmacological bioinformatics to predict disease risk, diagnose conditions, and recommend optimal therapies.


## Current Status
**Active Development**: The preprocessing pipeline has been built and we are currently curating training data from public datasets 

## Key Features (Planned)
- **Multi-Omics Integration**: Combine transcriptomics, genomics, and clinical data
- **Disease Prediction**: Machine learning models for risk assessment and diagnosis
- **Therapy Recommendations**: AI-driven personalized treatment suggestions
- **In Silico Testing**: Simulate drug effects on patient-specific pathways

## Roadmap 
- Phase 1: Data preprocessing pipeline
- Phase 2: Baseline ML models (Pending)
- Phase 3: Deep learning integration (Pending)
- Phase 4: Web interface deployment (Pending)
